# AberCS31810Work
This is some work that I have done in my module Computational Bioinformatics (CS31810) In Aberystwyth University

The report is available in this repository as: 'CS31810_Assignment_Comp_Bioinformatics.pdf'

To run all studies run ./mainPipe.sh
And will run various studies for all fasta files in origin 
Should not take more than a couple minutes. 


Pipeline uses: 
Python2(mainly) & 3(for NX.py):
	Librarys:
		sys
		scipy
		statistics
		operator
R:
	ggplot2
